Evaluation:
Along with the unit testing, you are also to conduct an evaluation of your UI design. For this you will be expected to review user interface evaluation approaches and select one specific approach that is appropriate to the system that you have developed. The choice of approach should be based upon both theoretical ground and also the practical constraints of evaluating your UI. You should report on how the evaluation was conducted, and the results obtained. The evaluations should be conducted with real users who are not members of your assignment team (up to 4 + 2 sides of A4, +2 being pictures and illustrations).

Critical Reflection:
Finally, you are required to produce a critical reflection report, focusing on the ways in which your groupâ€™s implementation differs from the original designs (including appropriate diagrams and code fragments to illustrate changes were appropriate) and explain the reasons for the change. You should also reflect upon the time management approach you used to plan the work required for this subtask (up to 2 sides of A4 remember, quality over quantity is being assessed).
